                <p class="text-lg mb-6">Proper HVAC maintenance is crucial for ensuring your system's longevity and efficiency throughout the year. As experienced professionals in Macon's HVAC industry, we've compiled comprehensive seasonal maintenance guidelines to help homeowners protect their investment and maintain optimal indoor comfort.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Spring Maintenance Checklist</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">As temperatures begin to rise, spring is the perfect time to prepare your air conditioning system for the demanding summer months ahead. Start by replacing or cleaning your air filters, which should be done every 1-3 months depending on usage and environmental factors. Clear any debris from around your outdoor unit, ensuring at least two feet of clearance for proper airflow.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">Check and clean your condensate drain line to prevent clogs that could cause water damage or system shutdown. Inspect and clean your evaporator and condenser coils to maintain optimal heat transfer and system efficiency. Don't forget to test your thermostat's accuracy and calibrate if necessary.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Summer Maintenance Priorities</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">During peak cooling season, regular monitoring becomes essential. Check your outdoor unit weekly for debris and clean as needed. Listen for unusual noises that might indicate mechanical problems. Monitor your energy bills for unexpected increases that could signal efficiency issues.</p>

                <p class="mb-6">Ensure proper airflow by keeping all vents unobstructed and regularly cleaning return air grilles. Consider upgrading to a programmable thermostat if you haven't already to optimize energy usage during peak hours.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Fall Preparation Steps</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Fall maintenance focuses on preparing your heating system for winter operation. Schedule a professional inspection of your furnace or heat pump. Replace batteries in carbon monoxide detectors and test them thoroughly. Check all heating vents and ductwork for leaks or damage.</p>

                <p class="mb-6">If you have a gas furnace, inspect the pilot light and burner assembly. Clean or replace the furnace filter and verify proper thermostat operation in heating mode. Consider a professional duct cleaning if it hasn't been done in several years.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Winter Maintenance Requirements</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">During winter, protect your outdoor unit from ice and snow accumulation while ensuring proper ventilation. Monitor indoor humidity levels and consider using a humidifier if the air becomes too dry. Keep all outdoor exhaust vents clear of snow and ice to prevent carbon monoxide buildup.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Professional Maintenance Benefits</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">While many maintenance tasks can be performed by homeowners, professional servicing twice yearly remains crucial. Professional technicians can identify potential issues before they become major problems, ensure safe operation, and maintain manufacturer warranty requirements.</p>

                <p class="mb-6">Regular professional maintenance typically includes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                    <li class="mb-2">Comprehensive system inspection</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Electrical connection tightening and testing</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Moving parts lubrication</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Refrigerant level checking</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Safety control testing</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Energy Efficiency Tips</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">Maintain efficiency by regularly cleaning or replacing filters, sealing duct leaks, and installing proper insulation. Consider upgrading to a smart thermostat for optimal temperature control and energy savings. Keep doors and windows properly sealed, and use ceiling fans to improve air circulation.</p>
